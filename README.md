This is a prototype to showcase the fundamental differences between three different approaches of managing the state of an object:

- Terrans: Simple state operations
- Protoss: State machine
- Zerg: Event-driven

These three approaches are not mutually exclusive, and this prototype is NOT a representation of how some of the approaches might look like in a real application.
